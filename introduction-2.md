# Introduction 2

*A Take On React Best Practices* is a high level overview of React and its ecosystem, and a set of best practices distilled from years of experience.

The target audience is developers with or without React knowledge, and team leaders, project managers ready to familiarize with the big picture. 

A priori web experience might help but often times it's an impediment. 

React is a new take on web and app development both in technology and workflow. It requires a new mindset for all participants in a project.

The next chapters will teach you:

- React is part of the functional and reactive programming paradigm.
- React comes with an ecosystem which is again functional and reactive.
- There are ways to write React apps and there is the quasi-official *Facebook way* serving as best practice.

More, you'll become familiar with concepts like:

- GraphQL and Relay, the *Facebook stack* to create data-driven applications.
- Single Responsibility Principle, the driving force behind the scene.
- UI before API, a new workflow and organizational structure tailored to React.

You'll be able to put React in context with:

- Event-driven architecture
- Domain-driven design
- Design systems

And get some trips and tricks like:

- Formal verification, a new way of testing.
- AWS AppSync, the best React infrastructure provider today.
- Open source packages, a set of curated and tested React accessories.
