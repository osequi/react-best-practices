# Functional and reactive programming

React follows the functional reactive programming paradigm[^1]. Thatâ€™s a shift from the old proactive, imperative approach.

Both paradigms solve the same problem in different ways: build *modular*, *interactive* applications.

The old way implemented modularity through tight-coupling, and interaction synchronously. The new way implements modularity with loose-coupling, and interaction asynchronously.

To clear the picture let's abstract modularity and interaction to *composition* and *coupling*.

Composition is about how the components of the system can add up to form a whole, while coupling is about how they communicate with each other.
