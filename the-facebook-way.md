# The Facebook way

React is an un-opinionated framework. Apps written in React vary in coding style from developer to developer, company to company.

As always, is best to follow the creators.

Facebook, the creator of React, published Thinking in React[^1] -- a set of guidelines "to think about apps as you build them" or  "the thought process of building with React".

Omitting these guidelines means reinventing the wheel. Chances are null for one to come up with a better solution unless masters better resources than Facebook.

As expected the advantages of Thinking in React show up after a couple of projects. 

- Decision making becomes easy. 
- Code written by a team looks like code written by a single person.
- A set of re-usable components and business logic (captured in hooks) emerges and grows from project to project.
