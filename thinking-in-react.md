# Thinking in React

[Thinking in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) is Facebook's opinion on how "to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript."

The knowledge distilled here comes from building their own Facebook and Instagram products. 

At the top of the document they rush to state React has a special way to think about app development. It's a different thought process than we are acustomed to.

## Start with a  Mock

In [What Are the React Team Principles?](https://overreacted.io/what-are-the-react-team-principles/) Dan Abramov, React core-member and developer advocate starts with: UI before API.

Now that's a completely new approach. Before React the thought process was:

1. The UI/UX design team creates mockups and wireframes.
2. The back-end team creates the API.
3. The front-end team merges the two together. 

Facebook realised this approach is flawed. What the users see -- the app -- is the result of a complicated merging process across multiple departments done at the end.

Instead, they said, let's start with front-end then connect everything else to it.  UI before API.

In Thinking in React front-end developers are empowered. They have that noble task to mock up the application, to create a responsive wireframe of what needs to be done.
