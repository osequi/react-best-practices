React is suitable for everyone because it's a completely novel approach to web development.

If one already knows HTML, CSS it might help, but it doesn't offer an outstanding advantage. Components and design systems hide these abstractions and incorporate the necessary knowledge to build the front-end. 

Programming experience helps only if it's functional. In React no one writes complex algorithms; instead manipulates the data flow using functional programming concepts.

The knowledge of older paradigms like MVC, REST and CRUD doesn't helps either. The React ecosystem -- GraphQL and Relay -- sports concepts unused previously in web frameworks.
