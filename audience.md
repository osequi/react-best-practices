React is for everyone. Either coming as a complete beginner from a coding school or having a priori web development experience.

Nor the perviously known programming languages and paradigms matter. Unless they are from the functional, event-driven spectrum.

React is suitable for everyone because it's a completely novel approach to web development.

If one already knows HTML, CSS and Javascript it might help but doesn't offer a real competitive advantage. Web components and Design Systems hide these abstractions and already incorporate the necessary knowledge to build web applications. 

Javascript knowledge only helps if it's functional. In React no one will write complex algorithms; instead it will manipulate the data flow using functional programming concepts like map, filter and reduce.

In the same way older paradigms like MVC, REST, CRUD, Client-server architecture are useless in the React ecosystem. With GraphQL and Relay comes queries, mutations and subscriptions -- concepts unseen in previous web frameworks.

When people are learning React they'll have to learn: 

1. React is not another web framework.
2. React is functional and reactive.
3. It comes together with a complete stack.
5. It's better to write React apps using the Facebook way.
