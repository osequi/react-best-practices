React is suitable for everyone because it's a completely novel approach to web development.

If one already knows HTML, CSS it might help but doesn't offer an outsanding advantage. Components and design systems hide these abstractions and incorporate the necessary knowledge to build web applications. 

Programming experience helps only if it's functional. In React no one writes complex algorithms; instead manipulates the data flow using functional programming concepts.

The knowledge of older paradigms like MVC, REST and CRUD doesn't helps either. The React ecosystem -- GraphQL and Relay -- sports concepts unseen previously in web frameworks.

When learning React one will find out: 

1. React is not just another web framework.
2. React is functional and reactive.
3. It comes together with am ecosystem, a complete stack from UI design to back-end servers.
4. React apps are best written using Facebook' guidelines.
