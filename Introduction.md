# Introduction

React is the most popular web framework today[^1].  

Created by Facebook in 2013 the ecosystem grew mature in 2019. The facebook.com redesign and rewrite is done exclusively with React, GraphQL and Relay[^2].

Strong company support attracts web developers coming from Javascript or from other programming languages. 

However, many of them find the learning curve for React steep[^3]. 

That's right. 

React is not *YAWF* -- Yet Another Web Framework[^4]. It's a completely new programming style and information architecture on the web. Nothing to share with previous paradigms like MVC and REST[^5].

Learning React means learning type-safety; functional and reactive programming; data-driven applications; graph databases and event-driven architectures.

And more. React requires a new thinking within a new context[^6].
