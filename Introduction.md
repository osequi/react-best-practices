# Introduction

React is the most popular web framework today[^1].  

Created by Facebook in 2013 the ecosystem grew mature in 2019. That year the facebook.com redesign and rewrite stack of choice is React, GraphQL and Relay[^2].

Strong company support attracts web developers coming from Javascript or from other programming languages. They often find the learning curve for React steep[^3]. 

That's right. React is not **Yet Another Web Framework (YAWF)**[^4]. 

It's a new programming style and information architecture for the web. Nothing to share with previous paradigms like MVC and REST[^5].

Learning React means learning type-safety; functional and reactive programming; data-driven applications; graph databases and event-driven architectures.

And more. React requires a new thinking within a new context[^6].
